# Ikou Network

## Criteria A

### Problem Definition
The problem addressed by the "Project Ikou" CAS group is a lack of a centralized platform for administrators to share/post information about cultural activities organized for the community around the Karuizawa Area, and for users to post and share their tourism experience in forms of blog posts. 
### Proposed Solution
As part of the CAS group, I discussed with my group mates, and confirmed that the client(Project Ikou) would like to have a website that allows users to post. The website should have a secure log in and sign up system, that also assigns the project members as administrators. The administrators could post planned trips and additional official activity informations that towns near Karuizawa provided to the group. Regular users can post trip experiences to the near by towns. The website would be made with Python flask, using html and css. User data would be stored in database files
### Rationale for Proposed solution
"Python Flask is a popular web framework used for developing web applications because of its simplicity and flexibility. Flask provides a lightweight and modular structure that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. It also has a built-in development server and support for multiple extensions, which can be used to add functionality to the application. Flask is particularly suitable for small to medium-sized web applications with low to medium traffic.

HTML and CSS are the foundation of web development. HTML provides the structure and content of the website, while CSS provides the styling and layout. Together, HTML and CSS provide the basic building blocks for creating visually appealing and responsive websites.

SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database management system that is suitable for small to medium-sized web applications. SQLite stores data in a single file, which makes it easy to use and maintain. It is also widely supported and has a large community, which means that developers can easily find solutions to problems they encounter.

In the context of the proposed solution, Python Flask, HTML, and CSS are appropriate because they are lightweight and suitable for the size and scope of the project. SQLite is also appropriate because it is a lightweight database management system that can efficiently store and retrieve data for the web application. Additionally, since the proposed solution requires a secure login and sign up system, SQLite's encryption capabilities can be used to secure the user data stored in the database files."
